### Data enterprise:
- Store relevant data.
- Access needed.
- Analyze the data.
- Data insights.

Traditional data warehouse architecture challenges:
- Difficult to scale.
- High overhead costs for administration.
- Costly and complex to access, refine, and join data from different sources.
- Cannot separate infrequently used and frequently used data.
- Limit the number of users and amount of accessible data.

### Amazon Redshift

Dramatically lowers the cost and effort associated with deploying data warehouse systems, without compromising on features, scale, and performance.
Fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehousing solution. 
Simple and cost-effective to analyze large volumes of data.

### Modern Analytics and Data Warehousing Architecture

**Data warehouses:** optimized for batched write operations and reading high volumes of data.

**Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases:** optimized for continuous write operations and high volumes of small read operations.

#### AWS Analytics Services
- Easy path to build data lakes and warehouses.
- Secure cloud storage, compute, and network infrastructure
- Analytics stack
- Best performance, the most scalability, and lowest cost for analytics.

#### Analytics Architecture
Designed to handle large volumes of incoming streams of data.
Stages:
1. Collect data
2. Store the data
3. Process the data
4. Analyze and visualize the data

#### Data Collection

**Transactional Data:**
- **NoSQL** suitable when the data is not well-structured to fit into a defined schema.
- **Relational Database Management Systems** suitable when transactions happen across multiple table rows and the queries require complex joins.

**Log Data:**
Capturing system-generated logs: troubleshoot issues, conduct audits, and perform analytics using the information stored in the logs.

**Streaming Data:**
Web applications, mobile devices, and many software applications and services generate streaming data that needs to be collected, stored, and processed continuously.

**IoT Data:**
Devices and sensors around the world send messages continuosly

#### Data Processing

**Batch Processing:**
- **Extract Transform Load (ETL)** pulling data from multiple sources to load into data warehousing systems.
- **Extract Load Transform (ELT)** extracted data is loaded into the target system first.
- **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** store aggregated historical data in multidimensional schemas.

#### Real-Time Processing
Record-by-record basis, or over sliding time windows. Real-time processing requires highly concurrent and scalable processing layer.

#### Data Storage
- **Lake house** enable you to query data across your data warehouse, data lake, and operational databases to gain faster and deeper insights that are not possible otherwise.
- **Data warehouse** run fast analytics on large volumes of data and unearth patters hidden in your data by leveraging BI tools.
- **Data mart** simple form of data warehouse focused on specific functional area or subject matter.

### Data Warehouse Technology Options

#### Row-Oriented Databases 
Typically store whole rows in a physical block. High performance for read operations is achieved through secondary indexes.
**Optimize techniques:**
- Building materialized views
- Creating pre-aggregated rollup tables
- Building indexes on every possible predicate combination
- Implementing data partitioning to leverage partition pruning by query optimizer
- Performing index-based joins

Limited by the resources available on a single machine. Every query has to read through all the columns for all of the rows in the blocks.

#### Column-Oriented Databases
Organize each column in its own set of physical blocks instead of packing the whole rows into a block. More input/output (I/O) efficient for read only queries.
Need less storage compared to a row-oriented database.

### Amazon Redshift Deep Dive

#### Performance
- **High performing hardware** maximize speed for performance-intensive workloads.
- **AQUA** Advanced Query Accelerator, runs up to ten times faster than any other cloud data warehouse.
- **Efficient storage and high-performance query processing** columnar storage, data compression, and zone maps reduce the amount of I/O needed to perform queries.
- **Materialized views** enable you to achieve significantly faster query performance for analytical workloads.
- **Auto workload management to maximize throughput and performance** machine learning to tune configuration to achieve high throughput and performance, even with varying workloads or concurrent user activity.
- **Result caching** deliver sub-second response times for repeated queries.

#### Durability and Availability 
Attempts to maintain at least three copies of data: the original and replica on the compute nodes, and a backup in S3.

#### Elasticity and Scalability
- **Elastic resize**  quickly resize your cluster by adding nodes to get the resources needed for demanding workloads, and to remove nodes when the job is complete to save cost. 
- **Concurrency Scaling** support virtually unlimited concurrent users and concurrent queries, with consistently fast query performance.

#### Amazon Redshift Managed Storage
Scale and pay for compute and storage independently so you can size your cluster based only on your compute needs.

### Operations
- Cluster Performance
- Cost Optimization

#### Ideal Usage Patterns
- Running enterprise BI and reporting
- Analyze global sales data for multiple products
- Store historical stock trade data
- Analyze ad impressions and clicks
- Aggregate gaming data
- Analyze social trends
- Measure clinical quality, operation efficiency, and financial performance in health care

#### Anti-Patterns
- **OLTP** choose a relational database system or a NoSQL database.
- **Unstructured data** data in Amazon Redshift must be structured by a defined schema.
- **BLOB data** to store binary large object (BLOB) files, store the data in S3 and reference its location in Amazon Redshift.
